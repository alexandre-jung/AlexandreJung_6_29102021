## Overview

A media gallery for photographers made as a [single page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA), inspired by the [MVC design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).  
Fetched data is cached and likes are persistant over navigation until the user reloads the document.  
Use [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) for [serving during development](#Getting&nbspstarted) and build.
